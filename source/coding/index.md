# Hi, I'm Avanish Shrestha

I'm a developer & research assistant at [Intelligent Systems Laboratory](http://isl.scitech.au.edu), Assumption University.

I work on Computer Vision and Machine Learning at ISL, and maintain multiple internal vision frameworks. I also develop iOS applications using _Swift_.
