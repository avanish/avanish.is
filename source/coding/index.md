# Hi, I am Avanish Shrestha

I am a reseach developer at [Intelligent Systems Laboratory](http://isl.scitech.au.edu), Assumption University.

I work with Computer Vision and Machine Learning ([Tensorflow](https://tensorflow.org)) at ISL, and maintain internal computer vision frameworks. I also work with big data on _Google Cloud_ & develop iOS applications using _Swift_.
